The purpose of this assignment was to tag/perform preprocessing on the tweets of various twitter accounts with a large amount of followers, and 
then to perform analysis on them and see how reliably tweets could be attributed to the correct author.

MakeLex and NLPlib were provided by the instructors, the other three python programs were written by me.
